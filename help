#so guys this is the file of explanation or called help file. I will give a help file for each of my repositeries..

Import - is going to import some files of an application. For discord there are some files for specialy made for making bots.
bot.run - is simply a text used for running the bot after finishing the code.
on_ready- when the bot is activated using bot.run the script will show on the console that the bot is online using the text you provided.
on_message- when a person send a message, on that specific message containing its command will make it react.

I THINK ITS THATS ALL

  ---------> and guys the code will completely work fine for replit 2024. You would have saw some tutorials but when u tried it, you would have found it wrong and bringing some errors. But if this makes an error,
  use the blackbox ai or CHATGPT for explanation and solving the problem.
